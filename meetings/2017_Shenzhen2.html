<h1>EarthScope-Oceans Steering Committee Meeting, SUSTech, Shenzhen, June 8-9, 2017</h1>
<hr>

1. Meeting started<br>

<blockquote>
Introductions. 
</blockquote>

2. Guust delivers the linked presentation on the agenda.

<blockquote>Local weather is very important in setting S/N level.<br>
We talk about location uncertainty, time uncertainty, interpolation
location corrections, and how ocean models could help - if they were
right.<br> <i>C&eacute;cile Joubert et al.</i>, SRL 2016<br> History:
MERMAID Phase I.<br> Now we are in MERMAID Phase II. 5 year
lifetime. Triggered P waves. Also data on demand.<br> 24 bit
recording.<br> <b>Data management.</b> Currently SAC and miniSEED
format. "Response" file exists for 1 MERMAID. Varying location is
other metadata that is being kept.<br> MERMAID PHASE III.<br>
<b>Programmable environment.</b> Need to agree on some standards,
scheduling, priorities. <i>S&eacute;bastien Bonnieux </i><br> What
about gliders? Also an example of multidisciplinary science, we can
learn from that, even though our platform is very different.<br>
MERMAID has *some* steerability if it exploits surface versus abyssal
current. Or could wait out strong surface currents.</blockquote>

3. Alessia talks.

<blockquote>Tim: Connection with IOC?  Mainly Argo right now. We will
hear from Mathieu<br> Alessia is waiting on approval for purchase of
14 MERMAIDS for deployment in 2018-2019. Joint deployment with JAMSTEC
and SUSTech. Tomography and geodynamics. Plume. Data sharing policy is
informal, but it was agreed that they will be shared, openly after 2-3
years. For now, vague and standard.</blockquote>

4. Tim talks.

<blockquote> DOIs, we should get one from IRIS/FDSN per pool.<br> We
should get some more geographical representation on DataComn.<br> URL
builders to formulate standard requests.<br> <b>SeisComP3</b>
developed by GFZ. Federated model of data centers.  Strongly
recommended to use SeisComP3. Easily expands to large numbers of data
types. Not even just seismic, even for IRIS.  Iris Federator. <b>ESO
should become a federated data center!</b> Iris also would be happy to
cohost. There would be a second center also. Shenzhen would be the
primary. Could be encrypted and password protected.  <br> FDSN is the
only seismological standards organization. Other than the proprietary
CTBTO.</blockquote>

5. Mathieu talks.<br>
   <blockquote>
   History and mission of JCOMMOPS under UNESCO, WMO. <br>
   Coordination, not direction. <br>
   They  "monitor close to 8000 platforms in the oceans.<br>
   1980 Law of the Sea. They help international coordination,
   deployment schedules, etc. They maintain warning system of running
   into economic ones from international waters.<br>
   Platform registered in system. Two types of warnings are being issued.<br>
   They can help with a deployment schedule, for a fee.<br>
   Acoustic is the new kid on the block, they need to be aware of this.<br>
   They should want to see an implementation plan.<br>
   UNESCO identification tags. <br> 
   Symbolic contributions needs to be discussed.<br>
   Network needs to come on the radar of the international community. A dot on the map.<br>
   Next year in Brest, should send a person to their meeting, May 2018.<br>
   All CTD type data needs to be coordinated nationally. Then, the international community has to accept. 
</blockquote>

6. Alessia talks.

<blockquote>Science committee objectives, and science committee composition.
</blockquote>

7. Yann talks.

<blockquote>Clock drift over a week is better than 1 millisecond, gets
synchronized with GPS at every surfacing.  There is 3.5 kg of buoyancy
available in the new Mermaid (compared to 0.5 in the old version). The
bladder expands to fill 3.5 l of water. ARM Cortex M4 proceesor, low
power. 5-6 year lifetime, 5.5 kWh of power available as 36 DD
cells. OSEAN designed its own hydraulic pump, tested for over 10k
cycles.<br> Mermaid as a lander, can be used for aftershocks etc. <br>
Current board can accommodate a SeaBird CTD integration as an add-on
package, from 4000 m up in 12 hours for a profile. Must use the
SeaBird ($8k) or else Argo will not take it; they tried another one
from Aanderaa (3.5) but Argo did not like it.  Whale vocalizations,
listen for a few minutes every 3-4 hours. Multimermaid board fits in
the same space and can be swapped in, with up to 8 channels.<br>
SeaTREC phase-change material generator.<br> Pinger could be next,
used for interfloat communication also. One month buffer is being
built. 25 k is transmitted to a satellite, then then to
switch.<br>
Buffer (now 10 events, soon 1 month). Spectrum. CTD. Pinger. Magnetometer. </blockquote>

8. Tim talks.

<blockquote> Data Committee makes a list of policy
recommendations. Openness on metadata should be immediate. Proprietary
period for science data.</blockquote>

9. Guust talks.

<blockquote>
Funding model. Foundations. Environmental angle. Biodiversity and plastics. Illegal fishing. 
</blockquote>
